I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see we're working in the payment-kit-master project, specifically in the `blocklets/core` directory. I notice you're on a feature branch called `feat-quote` with several modified files related to quote functionality.\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I can:\n- Explore the codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep\n- Run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n- Design and plan implementations\n- Provide detailed analysis and recommendations\n\nI **cannot**:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Install packages or make commits\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with? I'm ready to:\n1. Explore the existing quote feature implementation\n2. Design a plan for new requirements\n3. Analyze patterns and architecture\n4. Review the current changes on your branch\n5. Or any other planning and exploration task you have in mind!\n\nWhat are your requirements or what would you like me to investigate?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1338,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1338,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":252,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CX2eA7hFdkMtTLzgnQUaJ","type":"assistant","uuid":"88a77291-c63f-4e76-b9ed-ea5274633e93","timestamp":"2026-01-12T01:47:42.948Z"}
